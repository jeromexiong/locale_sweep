## Unreleased

- **Fix crash on the `flutter test --machine` startup line** — the CLI parsed
  every stdout line as a JSON object, but `flutter test --machine` first prints a
  JSON *array* line (`[{"event":"test.startedProcess","params":{...}}]`). The
  resulting `TypeError` was not caught by the `on FormatException` handler, so
  `run` and `update` aborted with an unhandled exception before writing any
  results or report. Both shapes are now decoded by one shared helper
  (`parseMachineLine` in `lib/src/cli/machine_output.dart`) that returns the
  event objects a line carries and ignores anything else. No public API change.

## 0.6.1

- **Truncation findings no longer fail direct tests** — truncation issues are now advisory in `flutter test` runs. They are recorded in `SweepResult` for the CLI's `--fail-on truncation` to handle, preventing unexpected test failures in existing suites after upgrading to 0.6.0.

## 0.6.0

- **Text truncation detection** — after every `pumpAndSettle()`, walks the render tree to find `RenderParagraph` nodes where text is silently truncated by `ellipsis`, `clip`, or `fade` overflow modes. Reports the text, locale, overflow mode, available vs. desired width, and maxLines. Catches localization bugs that overflow detection misses — translated strings that fit the container but lose content.
- **`--fail-on truncation`** — new category for the `--fail-on` flag. Truncation findings are included in Markdown, HTML, and JSON reports alongside overflows and ARB issues.
- **Report improvements** — Markdown and HTML locale summary tables include a Truncations column. HTML report adds a Truncations summary card. CLI summary line includes truncation count.
- **Backwards compatible** — `truncations` field defaults to empty; existing JSON results without it deserialize cleanly.

## 0.5.1

- **Reliable exit codes** — ARB-only findings now mark variants as failed and respect `--fail-on`; unexpected test, setup, compilation, and result-read failures always return a non-zero exit, even with `--fail-on none`.
- **Consistent reports** — Markdown, HTML, JSON, CLI summaries, and process exit codes now derive pass/fail state from the same result model. Reports also expose execution errors when a run is incomplete.
- **Current-run isolation** — every CLI invocation writes to a unique results directory, so stale files cannot contaminate a later report. Duplicate flow names across test isolates are preserved, and corrupt or partial results fail visibly.
- **Configuration propagation** — `sweepTest()` now loads the CLI-selected YAML file and environment overrides automatically. Explicit Dart arguments remain highest priority, including `screenshotDir`.
- **Safer CLI orchestration** — single-package, monorepo, shard, merge, and golden-update paths share the same validation and failure rules. Invalid categories, shard ranges, configs, flow selections, and missing packages fail clearly.
- 329 tests total across 17 test files.

## 0.5.0

- **Localizations integration** — new `localizationsDelegates` parameter on `sweepTest()`. Wraps the widget in a `Localizations` ancestor so `AppLocalizations.of(context)` works for individual screen tests without needing a full `MaterialApp`. Fallback Material/Widgets delegates are included automatically for all locales.
- **`baseLocale` config** — configurable base locale for ARB analysis. Set via `sweepTest(baseLocale:)`, YAML `base_locale:`, or `LOCALE_SWEEP_BASE_LOCALE` env var. Defaults to `'en'`.
- **`parseLocale()` helper** — proper BCP-47 locale parsing. Handles `en`, `en_US`, `pt-BR`, `zh_Hans`, `zh_Hans_CN`. Used internally and exported for user convenience.
- **Example app uses `flutter gen-l10n`** — all three example screens now use `AppLocalizations.of(context)` instead of hardcoded strings. Demonstrates both patterns: full `MaterialApp` with delegates (home) and screen-in-isolation with `localizationsDelegates` param (settings, profile).
- 320 tests total across 16 test files.

## 0.4.2

- **German umlaut fix** — screenshot gallery now renders proper umlauts (Übersetzungen, Prüfungen, Schlüssel, etc.) instead of ASCII fallbacks.
- **Japanese translations** — gallery screenshots use real Japanese text instead of untranslated English strings. Added NotoSansJP font for CJK rendering.
- **Version badge** — gallery screenshots updated from v0.1.1 to v0.4.1.

## 0.4.1

- **Example app** — 3 sweep tests across 8 locales (en, de, ar, ja, ko, he, th, hi) with intentional bugs: missing ARB keys, placeholder mismatches, untranslated strings, overflow layouts, RTL issues.
- **Arabic RTL screenshot** — README gallery now shows real Arabic text with mirrored layout instead of Config screen. Added NotoNaskhArabic font for proper rendering.
- **pub.dev Example tab** — updated `example.dart` with 64-variant sweep (8 locales × 2 scales × 2 viewports × 2 brightness).

## 0.4.0

- **Parallel sharding** — `--shards N --shard-index I` CLI flags split variant matrices across CI jobs. Passes through to `flutter test --total-shards/--shard-index`.
- **Merge command** — `locale_sweep merge -i shard_0 -i shard_1` combines shard reports into a single HTML/Markdown/JSON report. Supports `--github-pr` and `--fail-on`.
- **Monorepo support** — `locale_sweep scan` auto-discovers packages with `test/sweep/` dirs (checks `melos.yaml` first). `--packages apps/auth,apps/dashboard` runs sweep across multiple packages with merged reporting.
- **Landscape presets** — 4 new presets: `phoneSmallLandscape` (667x375), `phoneLandscape` (852x393), `phoneWideLandscape` (915x412), `tabletLandscape` (1024x768).
- **CLI progress** — real-time pass/fail counts during `flutter test` runs.
- **Environment overrides** — `LOCALE_SWEEP_LOCALES`, `LOCALE_SWEEP_TOLERANCE`, etc. for CI without modifying YAML.
- **setUp callback** — `sweepTest(setUp: () async { ... })` for loading custom fonts before the sweep group.
- **CLI parser extracted** — testable `cli_parser.dart` library with 43 new tests.
- **Bug fix** — ARB analyzer false positives on ICU plural/select syntax (`{count, plural, ...}`).
- **Bug fix** — CLI crash from transitive `dart:ui` dependency. Extracted `DiffResult` and `OverflowError` into pure-Dart files.
- **Bug fix** — removed `http` package dependency. `GitHubReporter` uses `dart:io` `HttpClient` directly.
- 283 tests total across 14 test files.

## 0.3.0

- **Screenshot diffing** — pixel-level diff via `GoldenDiffer.computeDiff()`. Per-channel threshold of 2 absorbs anti-aliasing jitter.
- **Tolerance** — `tolerance` parameter on `sweepTest()` and in `locale_sweep.yaml`. Screenshots within tolerance pass even when pixels differ.
- **Diff images** — 3-panel side-by-side (Golden | Actual | Diff) saved to `.locale_sweep/diffs/`. Changed pixels highlighted in magenta.
- **Diff in reports** — Diff % column in Markdown, diff badge + link in HTML, structured object in JSON.
- **DiffResult model** — `diffPercent`, `changedPixels`, `totalPixels`, `diffImagePath` with full JSON serialization.
- **Config** — `tolerance` key in YAML, `tolerance` and `diffOutputDir` params on `sweepTest()`.
- 202 tests total across 11 test files.

## 0.2.0

- **Dark mode** — `darkMode: true` on `sweepTest()` tests every variant in both light and dark brightness. Optional `lightTheme`/`darkTheme` params.
- **Variant exclusion** — `skip` callback to exclude specific locale/scale/viewport/brightness combos.
- **HTML report** — self-contained dashboard with dark theme, summary cards, screenshot gallery, interactive filters, locale summary table.
- **--fail-on** — CLI flag for selective failure categories (`overflow`, `arb`, `golden`, `all`, `none`).
- **Config validation** — warns on unknown keys (typos) and type mismatches. Falls back to defaults.
- **File-based results** — each flow writes JSON to `.locale_sweep/results/`. Isolate-safe, no global state.
- 167 tests total.

## 0.1.7

- CLI now reads `locale_sweep.yaml` config file via `--config` flag.
- CLI uses `GitHubReporter` for PR comments instead of duplicate HTTP logic.
- Added `variantBody` callback to `sweepTest()` for locale-aware test interactions.
